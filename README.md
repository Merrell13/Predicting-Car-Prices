# Predicting-Car-Prices
Machine Learning with Python 

The goal of this project is to use K Nearest to predict the market price of cars based on a number of it's attributes. K nearest computes the elucidean distance to find similarity and average in order to predict unknown values.

The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. You can read more about the data set [here-https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile].

Throughout the project I will be looking to achieve the lowest Square root mean squared error (RMSE). This will show that there is the smallest error between the price and the predicted price.

To start with we need to clean the data. Only numeric values will be useful for this project.
